            <h3>PROFESSIONAL BIO:</h3>
            <p>I was introduced to technology and the medical field through the medical field. Early in my 20's I
              helped a behavioral health private practice revamp all their computer systems, modernize their billing
              and collection software, and transition them from an entirely paper based charting system to an
              Electronic Medical Record. After attending college for a few semesters, I felt like I was missing
              something in my life though, I hadn't really found anything that fascinated me, until I became an EMT.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I was an EMT in both the deserts of Moab as well as in the Emergency
              Room of the University of Utah Hospital. Some key accomplishments that I obtained there were:
              <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Member of the Cardiac Arrest Rapid Response Team</li>
              <li>EMT Preceptor and Critical Care Skills Trainer</li>
              <li>Member of the Trauma Team</li>
              <li>Member of the Critical Care Team</li>
              <li>Medical Skill Preceptor to Resident Doctors for various skills within my scope</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            I was exposed to many Electronic Medical Record Systems such as Epic and InSync, Medical Image Sharing
            Databases such as PACS, and many other cutting edge tools such as Ultrasound Guided Procedures and Cardiac
            Monitoring software. Over the course of the last 5 years as medicine has captivated my mind, I have
            learned my true passion lies with the
            technology side of things and creating the tools of tomorrow. My vision is to write code that saves lives

          <p>
            Where to Begin? First and foremost, my spirit animal is an eagle.<br><br>
            I enjoy being outside in the sunshine. Fishing and Fly-fishing are my activities of choice. Randomly and
            sporadically through the week I enjoy channeling my inner viking and cooking over a fire or smoking some
            food in smoker.<br><br>
            I am an ultra-nerd, Avid anime-enthusiast, and my most recent DnD character class was cleric.<br><br>
            When I am not spending time with family I am probably working on increasing my coding knowledge, playing
            some games online with some friends, researching new rivers and lakes to go fish, or sleeping.
